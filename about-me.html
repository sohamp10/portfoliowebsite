								<p>Hi there, I'm Soham Patel, a computer engineering graduate from Indus University and currently pursuing post-graduation in artificial intelligence at Centennial College. With more than a year of field experience and three internships under my belt, I have developed a keen interest in the intersection of technology and artificial intelligence.</p>

								<p>My journey in the field of computer engineering started during my undergraduate studies, where I gained valuable experience in software development, data structures, and algorithms. During this time, I also discovered my passion for artificial intelligence, which led me to pursue a post-graduate degree in this field.</p>
									
								<p>Through my internships, I had the opportunity to work with some of the most innovative and dynamic organizations, where I developed practical skills in programming, data analysis, and machine learning. I was also able to hone my communication and teamwork skills, which have proven to be invaluable in my career.</p>
									
								<p>My values revolve around continuous learning and growth, which is why I am constantly exploring new technologies and ways to improve my skills. I am particularly interested in the potential of artificial intelligence to transform various industries and create solutions to complex problems.</p>
									
								<p>If you're interested in learning more about my experience or want to connect with me, please don't hesitate to reach out. I would love to hear from you!</p>
